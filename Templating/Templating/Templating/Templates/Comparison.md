# Best Libraries for Email Content Templating in C# .NET

In C# .NET, there are several libraries you can use to handle email content templating effectively. Below are a few popular and widely used ones:

## 1. RazorEngine
- **Overview**: RazorEngine is a templating engine that uses the Razor syntax, commonly used in ASP.NET MVC views. It allows you to generate HTML email content dynamically based on a template and model data.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios where you're already familiar with Razor templates, and you want to render dynamic content into an email.
- **NuGet**: RazorEngine.NetCore [20M, download]
- **Example**:
  ```csharp
  var template = "Hello @Model.Name, Welcome to @Model.Site!";
  var model = new { Name = "John", Site = "Example.com" };
  var result = Engine.Razor.RunCompile(template, "templateKey", null, model);

## 2. Scriban
- Overview: Scriban is a fast and lightweight templating engine. It has a simple and clear syntax, similar to Razor, but is more flexible and optimized for performance.
- Use Case: If you're looking for a highly performant templating engine with support for string interpolation and more, Scriban is a great option.
- NuGet: Scriban [21M download]
- Example:
  ```csharp
  Copy
  var template = "Hello {{ Name }}, Welcome to {{ Site }}!";
  var model = new { Name = "John", Site = "Example.com" };
  var result = Scriban.Template.Parse(template).Render(model);

## 3. Handlebars.Net
- Overview: Handlebars.Net is a .NET implementation of the popular Handlebars.js templating language. It's simple to use, logic-less, and provides helpers to manipulate data.
- Use Case: If you're familiar with Handlebars syntax or need a logic-less templating system, this is a solid choice.
- NuGet: Handlebars.Net [60M download]
- Example:
  ```csharp
  Copy
  var template = "Hello {{Name}}, Welcome to {{Site}}!";
  var model = new { Name = "John", Site = "Example.com" };
  var compiledTemplate = Handlebars.Compile(template);
  var result = compiledTemplate(model);

## 4. DotLiquid
- Overview: DotLiquid is a .NET port of the Liquid templating language (used in Ruby on Rails). It is designed for easy templating with support for simple logic and iterations.
- Use Case: If you need a templating engine with logic capabilities, DotLiquid can be useful.
- NuGet: DotLiquid [28M download]
- Example:
  ```csharp
  Copy
  var template = "Hello {{name}}, Welcome to {{site}}!";
  var model = new { name = "John", site = "Example.com" };
  var parsedTemplate = Template.Parse(template);
  var result = parsedTemplate.Render(Hash.FromAnonymousObject(model));

## Summary
- RazorLight: Best if you're familiar with Razor syntax and need to render HTML dynamically.
- Scriban: Great for fast and lightweight templating with a flexible syntax.
- Handlebars.Net: If you like Handlebars syntax and prefer logic-less templates.
- DotLiquid: A good choice for templating with more advanced logic features.

Each of these libraries has its strengths, so you can choose the one that best fits your specific needs, depending on the complexity of your email templates and your familiarity with different templating syntaxes.
